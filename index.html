            <h2>Hello.</h2>
            <p>I am a student learning web and mobile application development. This stuff is not just what I
                study, but also my passion and interest. I ❤️ to have coffee with my special someone.

                <h3>Design & Development</h3>
                <p>I started learning to code when I was 18 years old. Watching movies about technology, learning from
                    the stories of tech masters like Steve Jobs
                    and Mark Zuckerberg, has inspired me to keep pushing myself to overcome the obstacles on my way to
                    success. I'm excited to see where my coding journey will take me, and who knows, maybe one day I'll
                    create the next big thing in the tech industry!</p>

                <h3>Spicy Foods Challenge</h3>
                <p>I love the adventure of eating spicy food. The heat on my tongue enhances the flavors of a dish and I
                    enjoy experimenting with different spice blends and peppers. Adding a spicy twist to my favorite
                    dishes is a challenge that I embrace. For those who dare to try, eating spicy food is an
                    unforgettable experience.</p>
